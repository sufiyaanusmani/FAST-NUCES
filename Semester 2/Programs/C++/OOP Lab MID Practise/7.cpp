// Write a menu-driven program which converts length from feet and inches to meters and centimeters and vice versa. The program should contain three functions: showChoices, feetAndInchesToMetersAndCent, and metersAndCentTofeetAndInches. The function showChoices informs the user how to use the program. The user has the choice to run the program as long as the user wishes. (You should use both value and reference parameters for this program)
