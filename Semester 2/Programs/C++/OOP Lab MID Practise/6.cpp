// This programming exercise demonstrates a program that calculates a customer’s bill for a local cable company. There are two types of customers: residential and business. There are two rates for calculating a cable bill: one for residential customers and one for business customers. For residential customers, the following rates apply:
// - Bill processing fee: $4.50
// - Basic service fee: $20.50
// - Premium channels: $7.50 per channel.
// For business customers, the following rates apply:
// - Bill processing fee: $15.00
// - Basic service fee: $75.00 for first 10 connections, $5.00 for each additional connection
// - Premium channels: $50.00 per channel for any number of connections
// The program should ask the user for an account number (an integer) and a customer
// code. Assume that R or r stands for a residential customer, and B or b stands for a
// business customer
// Input: The customer’s account number, customer code, number of premium channels to which the user subscribes, and, in the case of business customers, number of basic service connections.
// Output: Customer’s account number and the billing amount.
// Because there are two types of customers, residential and business, the program contains two separate functions: one to calculate the bill for residential customers and one to calculate the bill for business customers. Both functions calculate the billing amount and then return the billing amount to the function main. The function main prints the amount due. Let us call the function that calculates the residential bill residential and the function that calculates the business bill business. The formulas to calculate the bills are the same as before.
